# MoodPy Generator Reorganization Summary

## Completed: Subject-Based Organization

Successfully restructured the MoodPy generators from `src/moodpy/subjects/` to `examples/` directory with improved organization and descriptive naming.

## Migration Summary

**Total Generators Moved**: 15 generators
**From**: `src/moodpy/subjects/` 
**To**: `examples/` (organized by subject)

### Subject Distribution

#### Economics (2 generators)
- `supply_demand_equilibrium.py` - Market equilibrium price calculation
- `profit_maximization.py` - Business profit optimization

#### Finance (4 generators) 
- `investment_term_template.py` - Investment period calculation template
- `annual_effective_return_template.py` - Annual return rate template
- `annuities_template.py` - Annuities calculation template  
- `empty_template.py` - Blank finance template

#### Mathematics (7 generators)
- `separable_differential_equations.py` - First-order separable EDOs
- `logistic_growth_curve.py` - Population growth modeling
- `second_order_homogeneous_edo.py` - Homogeneous 2nd order EDOs
- `second_order_edo_exponential_kernel.py` - 2nd order EDOs with e^(kx)
- `linear_function_non_rational.py` - Linear functions (non-rational)
- `linear_function_rational.py` - Linear functions (rational)
- `inverse_laplace_transform.py` - Laplace transform inversions

#### Statistics (1 generator)
- `discrete_correlation.py` - Discrete correlation analysis

#### Business (1 generator)
- `separable_differential_equations.py` - Business applications of separable EDOs

## New Directory Structure

```
examples/
├── basic/           # Simple demonstration generators
├── business/        # Business mathematics applications  
├── economics/       # Economic modeling and analysis
├── finance/         # Financial mathematics and calculations
├── mathematics/     # Pure mathematics (EDOs, transforms, functions)
├── reconstructed/   # Fully modernized v3.0.0 generators
└── statistics/      # Statistical analysis and probability
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Subject-Based Organization**: Generators grouped by academic discipline rather than migration status
2. **Descriptive Naming**: Files renamed based on actual content/functionality
3. **Consolidated Structure**: Removed artificial distinctions between "migrated", "basic", and "reconstructed"
4. **Updated Migration Framework**: `migrate_generator.py` now targets `examples/` directory

## Migration Framework Updates

- **Target Directory**: Changed from `src/moodpy/subjects/` to `examples/`
- **Maintained**: Subject-based organization and descriptive naming logic
- **Ready**: For continued migration of remaining 121 legacy generators

## Next Phase

The reorganization positions MoodPy for continued systematic migration of the remaining legacy generators with proper subject organization and improved educational value through descriptive naming.

**Phase 7 Status**: 15/136 generators migrated (11%) ✅ Reorganized by subject
**Overall Project**: ~70% complete with restructured foundation
