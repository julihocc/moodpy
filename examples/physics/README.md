# Physics Examples

This directory is ready for physics-related educational generators.

## Planned Content Areas

### Classical Mechanics
- Kinematics problems
- Newton's laws applications
- Energy and momentum conservation
- Rotational dynamics
- Simple harmonic motion

### Thermodynamics
- Heat transfer calculations
- Gas law problems
- Thermodynamic cycles
- Entropy and energy conservation

### Electromagnetism
- Electric field and potential problems
- Magnetic field calculations
- Circuit analysis
- Electromagnetic induction

### Modern Physics
- Special relativity basics
- Photoelectric effect
- Atomic structure
- Nuclear physics problems

## Integration with MoodPy

Physics generators will follow the same patterns as other subject areas:
- Inherit from `moodpy.Generator`
- Use parametric generation with validation
- Export to Moodle XML format
- Include step-by-step solutions

Physics problems often involve:
- Unit conversions and dimensional analysis
- Vector calculations
- Graphical representations
- Real-world applications

## Future Development

This directory will be populated as physics generators are:
1. Migrated from the legacy MoodPy collection
2. Reconstructed from existing XML outputs  
3. Newly developed for specific physics curricula
